# Routines AUTHOR guard — close the live-vs-repo drift footgun structurally.
#
# THE GAP (confirmed 2026-06-24, repaired in #263): routines-check.sh only diffs
# routines.yaml against the .routines-applied snapshot. It does NOT — and
# CANNOT, there is no claude.ai token in CI — verify the LIVE trigger carries
# that content. The autonomous executor runs in the cloud with
# allowed_tools=[Bash,Read,Write,Edit,Glob,Grep]: it has NO RemoteTrigger tool,
# so it CANNOT apply a routines.yaml change to the live trigger. When it edits
# routines.yaml and runs `make routines-mark-applied`, routines-check stays
# green but the live trigger silently drifts from the repo. That is exactly how
# #251's JANITOR rung + the docs/done STEP 6 went missing from the live trigger.
#
# SCOPE NARROWED 2026-07-15 (pointer architecture): routines/*.prompt.md files
# are no longer baked into any trigger at all — the live content is
# routines.yaml's `live_prompt` (a short, static pointer telling the run to read
# `prompt_file` from the checked-out repo and follow it). Editing a
# routines/*.prompt.md carries zero live-drift risk, so it's no longer
# protected here — any session, including the executor itself, may edit them
# freely, same as any other repo file. Only routines.yaml still drives live
# trigger state (cron/model/enabled/tools/live_prompt/environment) via the API,
# so it remains the one file this guard protects.
#
# THE STRUCTURAL FIX (removes the footgun, not just detects it): forbid
# executor-authored commits from touching routines.yaml at all. Only
# INTERACTIVE Claude Code sessions — which DO have RemoteTrigger and so can
# actually apply + `make routines-mark-applied` in the same session (CLAUDE.md
# "Routines: edit-then-apply is one atomic step") — may change routines.yaml.
# If the executor needs a routines.yaml change (new cadence, model bump, a
# different live_prompt), it opens an issue for a human, the same way it defers
# any other out-of-tier work.
#
# DETECTION (no claude.ai token needed): the executor always lands on a branch with
# routines.yaml's `branch_prefix` (auto/), and commits as the cloud identity
# "Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>". Either signal marks the change executor-authored.
# If an executor-authored change touches routines.yaml -> fail. Interactive
# sessions (any other branch + a human commit author) pass, since they CAN apply.
#
# Mirrors the readme-check / roadmap-check / routines-check drift guards:
# scripts/<thing>-check.sh + `make routines-author-check` in `make ci` + bats
# coverage in tests/drift-detectors.bats. Also runs in the GitHub Actions drift job
# (the real gate on a pushed auto/* PR — see .github/workflows/ci.yml).
#
# Exit 0 = clean; 1 = an executor-authored change touched routines.yaml.
#
# Test/CI seams (so the logic is unit-testable without a live git history):
#   ROUTINES_AUTHOR_ROOT     repo root override (fixtures)
#   ROUTINES_AUTHOR_BRANCH   branch under test (else GITHUB_HEAD_REF / GITHUB_REF_NAME / git)
#   ROUTINES_AUTHOR_FILES    newline-separated changed files (else `git diff` vs main)
#   ROUTINES_AUTHOR_IS_CLOUD =1 forces the cloud-author signal on (else derived from git)
