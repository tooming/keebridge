# Routines sync check: catch edits to routines/routines.yaml that haven't been
# "applied" to the live claude.ai trigger. The "apply" step is when Claude Code
# calls `RemoteTrigger update` with routines.yaml's cron/model/enabled/tools/
# live_prompt/environment fields — see routines/README.md "Changing a routine".
# After applying, refresh the snapshot with `make routines-mark-applied`.
#
# Why only routines.yaml: since the 2026-07-15 pointer-architecture change, a
# live trigger's actual content is `live_prompt` — a short, static instruction
# to read `prompt_file` (e.g. executor.prompt.md) from the checked-out repo and
# follow it in full. `prompt_file` content is NEVER baked into a trigger, so
# editing routines/*.prompt.md carries no drift risk and needs no apply step at
# all; only routines.yaml itself is ever pushed to the live API.
#
# Why this script: the claude.ai trigger backend cannot be reached from CI
# (no exposed token — see routines/README.md). So we can't fetch the live
# state from a shell. Instead we record, in-repo, the sha256 of routines.yaml
# as-of the last successful apply. CI then enforces "did anyone edit
# routines.yaml without re-applying?" by diffing current content vs snapshot.
#
# Exit 0 = in sync; 1 = drift (instructions printed).
